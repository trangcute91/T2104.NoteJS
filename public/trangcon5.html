        <h2>Gossiping about sponge cake</h2>
        <p class="tieude">Cake (Vietnamese or translated as Banh Lan) is the name used to refer to a group of cakes with a soft, fluffy and fluffy texture, often used with jams, fresh cream or fruits. So in the Cake group, of course, there will be many different types of cakes and each type will have its own name, but because in Vietnamese, I often use the word "Banh Lan" to refer to all cakes in the Cake group, To better understand the difference and also to avoid confusion, Thuan would like to use the correct English name of each type as below.</p>
        <h2>1.Sponge Cake</h2>
        <img class="chuthich" src="https://bakez.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/b%C3%B4ng-lan-c%C6%A1-b%E1%BA%A3n_basic-sponge-cake_bakez.jpg">
        <p>This type is probably the most popular and famous in the Cake group :D. Most of the ice cream or mousse cake you often eat is called Sponge cake. About how to make, Sponge cake uses whipped egg whites to create a fluffy, spongy cake instead of baking agents (you will learn about expanders in the next lesson), so the texture of the cake is also soft. and much lighter.</p>
        <h2>2.Genoise</h2>
        <p>Being a "closer brother" to Sponge cake because the method and ingredients used to make Genoise are almost identical to Sponge cake. The only difference that distinguishes this cake from Sponge cake is the amount of fat in the recipe because Genoise usually uses more fat (butter, cooking oil, ..) than Sponge cake (little or no substance). fat). However, current Sponge cake recipes also contain the same amount of fat as Genoise, so these two cakes are often considered one and the same.</p>
        <img class="chuthich" src="https://bakez.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/genoise_bakez.jpg">
        <h2>3.Pound cake</h2>
        <p>Unlike the two cousins above, the ratio of ingredients used in Pound cake is different and so the texture and taste are also distinctly different.</p>
        <img class="chuthich" src="https://bakez.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/pound-cake_bakez.jpg">
        <p>The standard Pound cake has a ratio of ingredients: 1 butter: 1 sugar: 1 flour: 1 egg (all converted to pounds, so it's called pound cake) so the cake has a soft, moist, buttery texture. but a bit dry, when eating, there is often a feeling of choking, choking. However, thanks to the low-liquid ingredients, the cake has a fairly solid structure and can withstand a large amount of weight, which is very suitable for making cake cores for multi-tiered cakes.</p>
        <h2>4.Butter cake</h2>
        <img class="chuthich" src="https://bakez.vn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/butter-cake_b%C3%B4ng-lan-b%C6%A1_bakez.jpg".>
        <p>Butter cake (also known as Butter cake in Vietnamese) is also a "closer brother" to Pound Cake, but this cake is more popular because of its soft, moist texture, not too dry like Pound cake thanks to the amount of milk stored. added in the formula. Similar to Pound cake, Butter cake uses raising agents to create a fluffy, fluffy texture for the cake.</p>
        <h2>5.Chiffon</h2>
        <p>Being a "half-brother" with Sponge cake and Genoise because of the similarity in the ingredients used, however, the method is different (thus the "half-brother" :D). It is also thanks to the difference in the way that Chiffon has a true texture "soft as cotton, light as a cloud", not only cotton foam but also very light, no matter how much you eat, you will not get sick.</p>
        <img class="chuthich" src="https://afamilycdn.com/2017/chiffon-sua-chua-8-1500380939615.jpg">
        <p>However, the way to make Chiffon requires a lot of techniques as well as specialized tools. Chiffon will be a difficult "competitor" for inexperienced bakers.</p>
