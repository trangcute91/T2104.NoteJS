        <p>As one of the "hot" professions today, baking is attracting a lot of attention. Many people also choose baking as a career to pursue and develop for their career. Referring to the profession of baking, people will think of a light job, high income and working in luxurious environments. However, exploring deeper into this profession, we can see that baking is not only "sweet".</p>
        <p class="tieude">Behind the sweet cakes</p>
        <p>When entering the profession of baking, bakers always have to face many difficulties and challenges in their work to perfect themselves every day and bring the best quality products.</p>

        <p>First, perhaps there is a need to cultivate professional knowledge. To be able to manually create sweet and attractive cakes, the most important thing is that the craftsman must be skilled. Each craftsman still perfects his expertise by himself, accumulating experience every day through each batch of bread.</p>

        <p>Don't think of baking as a light job, a baker without health will have a hard time kneading perfect batches of dough, or persistently standing all day on his feet to make cakes, watch ovens, produce delicious cakes delicious cake. Not only that, you also always have to keep yourself healthy, avoid infection in person because a baker will not be able to directly make cakes when they are sick because of the risk of infecting customers through the cakes.</p>
        <p>Especially when you are pursuing a career in baking, there is also the factor of work pressure. When unfortunately "wrong cup" to make a batch of cakes have to "go a mile" just because the temperature is not correct or a little error in the preparation of ingredients. Therefore, a baker must always practice patience and calm to be able to handle any situation that occurs, even the worst.</p>
        <p class="tieude ">Calmness and patience are two qualities a baker needs</p>
        <p>A baker must not only be equipped with professional knowledge and skills, but also have to constantly improve his social knowledge and foreign language skills to adapt to many different working environments. together. This will be one of the factors that help bakers have more job opportunities in today's time and not fall behind their colleagues.</p>
        <p>The baker must train himself a pair of skillful hands, pay attention to every little detail, create a highlight for each cake with his talent.
          Following the profession of baking and becoming a professional baker, each batch of cakes you make is not simply to win customers' sympathy for the beauty on the outside but also to conquer them by the taste hidden inside. At that time, all hardships will disappear to make way for joy and pride.</p>
